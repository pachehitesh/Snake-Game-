# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle module. The game provides a fun and interactive way to learn programming concepts such as control flow, event handling, and basic game mechanics.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Control the snake to eat the green food pellets while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake itself.
   
2. **Controls**: 
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake:
     - Up: Move the snake upwards
     - Down: Move the snake downwards
     - Left: Move the snake to the left
     - Right: Move the snake to the right

3. **Gameplay**:
   - The snake will grow longer each time it eats a food pellet.
   - If the snake collides with the walls or itself, the game ends.
   - The length of the snake is displayed in the console each time it eats a food pellet.

## Dependencies

This game relies on the following Python modules:
- `turtle`: Used for graphics and animation.
- `random`: Utilized for generating random positions for the food pellet.
- `freegames`: Provides utility functions for drawing shapes.

## How to Run

To run the Snake game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
5. Run the `snake.py` file using Python:

   ```
   python snake.py
   ```

6. Enjoy playing the Snake game!
